				In the 1920s during Prohibition in the USA many Americans visited
				Montreal for a good time and the city flourished. Jacques Cartier Bridge
				opened in 1930 and Montreal Botanical Gardens was founded in 1931.
				However like the rest of the world Montreal suffered during the Great
				Depression of the 1930s. Nevertheless Sun Life Building was completed
				in 1931 and Atwater Market opened in 1933. Furthermore prosperity
				returned to Montreal with the Second World War. By 1951 the population
				of Montreal was over 1 million. In the 1960s several notable buildings
				were erected in Montreal including Place Bonaventure. Meanwhile Place
				Versailles Shopping Mall opened in 1963. A metro system opened in 1966.
				The International World Exposition was held in Montreal in 1967. Then in
				1976 the Olympic Games were held in Montreal. The Palais des congres de
				Montr√©al was built in 1983 and the World Trade Centre opened in 1992.
