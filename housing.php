				Montreal’s housing market is made up of more than 50% renters. The city
				to incorporate high rise buildings and many different apartment styles.
				For example, there’s the studio/loft: which is generally one large open
				space with a mezzanine for sleeping. There’s the duplex and the triplex,
				the “typical” Montreal apartment with winding stairs: two and three story
				apartment buildings where each unit has its own entrance. A less common
				building type is the bloc; multiple apartment buildings with a central
				entrance shared among the tenants. Full houses are also available for rent.
