					I'm always struck by the creativity of this city.
				You see it in the splendid dishes being stirred up
				in restaurant kitchens, the great performances
				on stage, and you even see the creativity walking down
				the street through incredible urban art lurking in
				unexpected places. The dual French-English mix adds dynamism
				to the city as does its unique mash-up of European and North
				American culture. As to why I was there in the first place. I
				came to visit this city when my family took a road trip to
				see my aunt and her side of the family. It was a splendid time
				in my life that Iâ€™ll never forget.
