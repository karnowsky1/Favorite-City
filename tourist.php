				Climbing Mont Royal is one of the first things you wanna do in montreal.
				There’s beautiful scenery and it’s entirely free. And on the plus side,
				if you get there early, during the sunrise, you can see the background
				image in person!

				Île Sainte-Hélène and the artificial island of Notre-Dame were the
				site of Expo '67. They are now known as Parc Jean Drapeau and have
				many family attractions. A remnant of the 1967 world fair, the Biosphere
				is now a museum dedicated to ecological issues. The building is designed
				in the shape of a sphere and used to be the largest structure in the
				world. Other tourist attractions on the islands include the rides and
				games of La Ronde Amusement Park, the historic 1820 British arsenal at
				the Stewart Museum, Bassin Olympique (where the Olympic rowing events
				were held), and race course Circuit Gilles Villeneuve.
